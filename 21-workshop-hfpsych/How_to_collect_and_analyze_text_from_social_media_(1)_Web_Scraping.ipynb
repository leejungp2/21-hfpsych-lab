I've been trying to stay positive all these years. My friends would describe me as the ultimate extrovert, I'm very social at parties, I'm funny and positive.  I'm fit, I'm attractive, I'm smart. I'm not trying to brag, but I know my worth and I know my weaknesses. Only a few know though how I feel deep down. \\n\\nI've really been trying to put myself out there. All dating apps in the book, sports clubs, parties, friends of friends. Ever since my last ex left (4 years ago) I haven't even been close to having a boyfriend again. And it's not because I never like anyone. In the past four years, I've probably really liked about 10 different guys (even had feelings for  few) and in the end they never wanted me. They would date me, sleep with me and then they would tell me they don't want anything serious. And I'm not going for the typical douchebag looking guys. I've been disappointed again and again and still I tried to meet guys.\\n\\nWhen I was younger I always dreamed of having  family. A husband, kids and a dog. Now, at 32, this seems incredibly far away. A few months ago, I thought I got pregnant by a guy that I was seeing for about two months. How sad is it that I was almost hoping I was actually pregnant? Somehow I thought that this might be the only chance I'll ever have for having a child, even if I'd be a single Mom. \\n\\nAll of my single friends complained about not finding anyone, and yet they all found someone. I'm the only one who never did. My best friend can't believe it and says my love live is jinxed. I don't know anyone who's so incredibly unlucky with dating. At this point I'm a 100% sure I'll end up alone. I guess I'll have to accept that the best thing that I can get dating-wise is good sex and some companionship. And I hate that this makes me sad, but it just sometimes does.\\n\\nAnyone 30+ feeling the same?\",\n",

              "  'I turned 27 on the 15th, so not quite 30 yet, but with how fast these 7 years have flown by I know I\\'ll be there soon. I haven\\'t had any real friends in about 15 years and I\\'ve never even kissed a girl. I get along with people fine, no one really ever dislikes me. Hell, I even get praised for how well I can read and empathize with people. But despite that, I am completely unable to form any deep connection with anybody. Due to circumstance, and then later anxiety, I was pretty much completely socially isolated between the ages of 13 and 23. Because of this, I missed out on a lot of formative experiences, and this makes it almost impossible for me to relate to those around me. I often feel like I\\'m not really a person, like I\\'m some kind of anomalous entity that appeared from nothing with no past behind me and seemingly no future ahead. That 10-year gap is just a blur to me, I honestly can\\'t pick out a single event. The only I got from it is weird interests and tastes in media that I have a lot of trouble opening up about, making it even harder to connect to people. And from the other direction, when people try to open up to me, I\\'m never able to relate to their interests. I\\'m just too far removed from the modern zeitgeist.\\n\\nThe thing is, I thought I was doing better. But now it all feels like it\\'s falling apart. I started a new job about two years ago and, unlike my last job, I made a lot of casual work friends but I still couldn\\'t form any real relationships. Whenever I suggested we do something outside work there would be some reason it couldn\\'t happen. And the few times anyone did agree something would always come up, or they would conveniently \"forget\" despite me confirming the plans the day before. I would get \"vibed\" out of group conversations for my inability to relate, usually by suggesting I go work on something while everyone else continued to chat. But the real wake up call came on my birthday. I was falling into a bad depression and I turned to the person I thought I was the closest to only for them to get angry at me for slacking and putting all the work on them. And this after I had covered for them more times than I can count without them ever doing the same in return. They then told me that they would listen to my problems \"as long as it would get me to work harder\". This was on my birthday by the way, and the only thing I got was a store-bought cupcake from my manager, despite me having gotten several of my coworkers birthday gifts in the past. I felt so betrayed at first, but after giving it some thought I came to the realization that none of these people were actually my friends. They were in my life out of work obligation, not choice. So desperate I am for human connection that I was inflating these casual acquaintances into personal friends. And it was this overbearing desperation that was getting me shunned more than anything else. I\\'m so mortified by this realization that I have since become completely withdrawn. I am now in the worst depression of my life. It\\'s hard to get out of bed, let alone make it through a workday. And I\\'ve completely lost my ability to work on any of my personal goals or hobbies.\\n\\nThe thing is, I honestly couldn\\'t care less about what my coworkers think of me. I just want someone to talk to, that I can share things with. And I want a girlfriend, someone I can hold and love. I want to be able to be there for people and know that they\\'re there for me. I want to be wanted, and I want to belong. And I have no idea how to help myself. I don\\'t know where to go or what to do, especially with the world on fire like it is. And now on top of everything else, I don\\'t know if I can even form normal relationships being as desperate as I am.\\n\\nToday was my day off, I spent the whole thing dreading tomorrow. I have no idea how I\\'m going to muster the strength to make it through another workday. I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m suicidal, but I feel so cornered, I understand now how someone could be. I just want to get my life together before it\\'s too late\\n\\n**e: Thank you to everyone for your responses, you really made a difference. I\\'m honestly feeling a lot better about things for the first time in over a week. And thank you to the people who messaged me through chat who I haven\\'t been able to respond to yet.

              "  'I lost a really deep friendship/relationship six months back, back around early January. They used to mean the world to me and I’ve seen them go down such a rabbit hole of bad choices. Ever since they left, they’ve gotten worse over this time. I worry about them still, but they’ve made it clear they don’t want anything to do with me. I miss their touch, the comfort I get from merely being in their presence, I miss their companionship. The thing is, I want to fall in love again. I want it so fucking badly, but there’s nobody else that’s a good match. Even more so, I don’t have the time for such an adventure at this point in life(I’m a teen). I’m busy as hell for the next year but I miss human contact so much. I’m not looking for sex, and I’m not looking for something short term either. I want a relationship, but I want background to it. It’s so much to ask for and I’m so conflicted with it all, but I miss the feeling of love so much. I crave it all the time, and I tell myself I’m worth someone’s hard work, but the times I’ve put myself out there, both myself and others have simply gotten hurt, and things just...didn’t click. It doesn’t feel right, I don’t feel things with others, and I crave human contact. Real human contact. I haven’t felt loved in six months, and it eats away at me seeing the one person I’ve ever loved with my entire being move on and make stupid decisions, when I’m willing to be by their side and help them through their rough patches. I’m tired, and lonely. I don’t know what to do anymore and it’s been eating away at me since January. Someone, help. None of my friends have given me thorough advice and to be fair, I can’t blame them. It’s a tough situation to battle and even I can’t wrap my head around getting through this, and I’m usually good at managing myself. I’ve tried moving on, but that doesn’t change my desires for feeling loved',\n",

I read the heartbreaking stories of loneliness from many different walks of life: young and old, men, women and children.\\n\\nMy own experience with loneliness is quite simple. My father cheated and divorced my mother shortly after my birth. My father was harsh with my upbringing due to his fears that my mother, who won custody, would raise his son to be a sissy.\\n\\nFor most of my schooling, I was able to make a few friends although I battled with social anxiety and low self-esteem. After high school I lost contact with most of my friends. At college I made a few “study-buddies” but not really true friends.\\n\\nAfter graduating, I pursued further studies. At that time, I experienced what might have been depression although I was never formally diagnosed. My studies were severely impacted and I barely managed to graduate.\\n\\nAfterwards, I found work at a start-up in a basic administrative position. During that time, I began to think about my life. Despite my desire to do something meaningful in the world, I had wound up being quite average in most regards. I was friendless and worked a job that barely covered my necessities.\\n\\nOne day as I was walking home, I was suddenly hit with a deep and profound feeling of loneliness. Two years passed, yet I continued to feel intensely lonely and isolated. At work, I had been promoted a couple times and was no longer doing administrative chores. Despite this, my confidence was quite low.\\n\\nOne summer, we temporarily hired a vibrant, energetic university student during her summer break and I was assigned as her supervisor. Over time we grew close and on one occasion she flirted with me but I rejected her advances because of my position as her supervisor . After that incident, I distanced myself from her despite reciprocating her feelings.\\n\\nAfter she left, my loneliness deepened so I threw myself into my work. Over the next two years, I’d successfully coordinated a couple important projects and also managed to make a couple friends through work. I felt fulfilled to an extent.\\n\\nThen one day, out of the blue, an old acquaintance who I’d been in contact with over the years began messaging me constantly: from the moment I woke, to when I got ready for bed. Eventually she asked me if I ever had any feelings for her and I candidly admitted that I did at some point.\\n\\nWe met for drinks and about a month later, we were in a relationship. It was a rushed decision. While I was a quiet, introverted guy, she was an extravert with a very busy social life that included regular parties and clubbing. I went to a few with her, but I never enjoyed those things and would usually wait in a corner until she was ready to leave.\\n\\nShe earned far more than I did and her friends and acquaintances were all in her income bracket. I slowly began to resent that I earned so much less. I hated my old run-down car, especially in comparison to her flashy new car. I hated that I couldn’t take her to the sort of fancy restaurants she was accustomed to. I constantly felt like I needed to compensate for lacking so much. I’d never felt so inadequate in my life.\\n\\nSeveral months later, our disparities began to affect the relationship. My insecurities manifested as bitterness and mistrust. My mistrust was an especially huge issue. My father’s betrayal of my mother had made me a very untrusting person and as my girlfriend and I grew apart, I began to become more and more suspicious of her. I never outright accused her of cheating but she could sense my mistrust.\\n\\nWe started having frequent arguments and one day she revealed that she was no longer attracted to me and that she had feelings for an ex and wanted to meet him privately to “find closure”. At this point, perhaps a rational person would have realised that the relationship was over but I had developed an unhealthy attachment and I held on desperately to the fact that she hadn’t outright broken up with me.\\n\\nI made all sorts of desperate gestures to win her back like sending her a bouquet at her office and asking her out on dates (all of which she declined). Eventually she grew tired of everything and broke up with me in person.\\n\\nIn the ensuing grief, I took some time off from work. I couldn’t cope and my performance took a hit. About 5 months later, she messaged to tell me that she had moved on and found someone new. I wished her all the best.\\n\\nAs time passed, I was able to look at the things more objectively. Truth was that I felt very lonely in the relationship. She spent most of her time partying and travelling. When we did spend together, she was more engrossed with her phone. We lacked true connection and in the end I felt more like an accessory to her perfect life than an actual partner and companion.\\n\\nI started working on my problems. I began therapy and journaling. Through meditation and introspection, I learned some simple truths. At the end of the day, you have only yourself. Life is rarely filled with constants. People will inevitably come and go as they are swept up in the currents of their own lives; their own goals and desires.\\n\\nYou must learn to become comfortable in your solitude. You must take care of your own emotional wellbeing. It’s unfair to expect someone to come into your life and magic away all of your suffering. A romantic partner isn’t your personal therapist/motivational coach and isn’t responsible for your happiness. Getting a partner isn’t going to make your depression, anxiety or loneliness disappear.\\n\\nUnhealthy relationships begin when you enter with the mindset that the relationship is going to solve a problem or deficiency in your life. Sadly, many people think, “If only I had a girlfriend/boyfriend I would be better off.” The truth is that you won’t. That’s like bringing a friend into your house that you haven’t cleaned in years and handing them a broom and telling them, “Clean this up.”\\n\\nConfront your life! Identify the sources of your pain and deal with them. Clean your own house! It won’t be easy, and it may take years (I’m certainly far from completing the necessary work), but it will be worth it in the end.',\n",

I don’t really interact much with people at school other than having short, shallow chat with acquaintances. I don’t talk to my mom very much at home because I can’t trust her and our relationship has been damaged over the years ever since we lost my dad to cancer. I don’t have an “inner circle” simply because nobody has really tried to be a close friend/my attempts at making friends fails. I’ve tried and tried to socialize and preserve the connection, but it always ends up being pleasant for moments and then fading back. \\n\\nHaha, it’s actually kinda funny. In Saturday school, I was sitting next to my crush and we were clicking pretty well. At one point she said, “I wish someone would love me just as much as Mandalorian loves Baby Yoda” (can’t remember the exact comparison very well, but we were talking about the Mandalorian so I’m like 70% sure). I was saying inside my mind, “hey, I’m right here and I’ve been trying!” Just thought that was a funny little example. \\n\\n——\\n(unnecessary BS you don’t have to read to understand the point) \\n\\nAnyways, I think my social ineptness came from experiencing the loss of my dad. It wasn’t easy watching him slowly die and then having to suddenly move around the state while barely being able to afford dinner. I kept to myself a lot because I knew other kids wouldn’t understand me. I hated having to constantly reform connections, so I didn’t reach out. And I was angry at everything. I hated my mom even though she was trying her best. Growing through that transitional phase where a kid becomes a teen in the absence of my dad was difficult for me. I’m sure others have had it much harder than I have, though. But anyways, I think I made the mistake of not exercising my social skills or connecting like everyone else around me, because now I can’t even hold a decent conversation. \\n\\nAlthough now it’s mostly just for fun and entertainment now, I even started an Instagram page where I post piano videos and other stuff I’m mediocrely decent at in an effort to “put myself out there” and boost my self-confidence through the approval of others, which isn’t the right idea.\\n\\nI just want to get out of this isolation. I want to be able to make friends. I want to connect. I want to get with the person who I’m interested in (that’s a stretch but a guy can dream). I want to stop being such a social wimp and actually be significant to and for others. I’ve been trying for years but nothing’s changing. I don’t think anything will, either. \\n\\nAnyways, if you’ve read up to here, thanks. Again, I’m not sad or giving myself pity, I just needed a place to reflect and express.',\n",

I’ve always been a really introverted guy, and the only people I really talk to are my roommates and a couple of friends occasionally from back home, otherwise nobody ever texts/Snapchats/calls me. I’ve coped with this throughout the years but when COVID became a big problem things got really bad because even the small interactions I would have with people in class and stuff was now gone.\\n\\nThanksgiving and Holiday break are coming up for me, and this year I will be completely alone. No friends, no family, nothing. I live with four other guys and they have all left to go home and won’t be back at our apartment until late January. I’ve just been thinking about how everything for these next couple of months will be me by myself. I’m literally doing nothing for thanksgiving, my birthday is over holiday break and I doubt that I will be doing anything for that (honestly I don’t even remember the last time I actually celebrated my birthday in any way). The only time I’ll actually see people I know will be during Christmas because I’ll definitely go home for that. \\n\\nI guess the reason why I’m posting this is to ask, what’s the best way to cope with this?

They started to develop new interests and started wanting new friendships. Although I only had 2 friends before, 2 or even 1 was enough for me. They began slowly drifting away. It was subtle until it finally hit that I was losing them, losing them to a more popular crowd. I understand why they would want that. Who doesn’t want more friends. No one wants to be the kid that no one remembers in high school. So they left. This broke me. I felt I had no one. No one to talk to. No one to laugh with. No one to share happy moments. I felt truly lonely. \\n\\nI read an article that mentioned, “Relationships are the most important overall contributor to happiness.” Knowing this made me feel even worse about myself. It made me feel like I wasn’t capable of happiness. It made me want to think about everything wrong with me, the reason why I could get or even keep any friendship. I started to think about every flaw I had. ‘Too ugly. Too boring. Too annoying. Too needy. Too pathetic.’ I thought about my looks. ‘Maybe it’s my nose. Or lack of breasts. Maybe it‘a cause I’m too hairy for a girl. Or cause I don’t try enough.’ I thought how I could change, but not in a good way. “I should start wearing makeup to hide my ugly face. I should start wearing cloths that are more revealing. I should start acting like someone else, like the pretty, popular girls.” \\n\\nAll these thoughts raced through my head until I just gave up. I didn’t care how I looked. I didn’t care how I felt anymore. I just wanted it all to be over. I fell into a depression. The loneliness took over me, leaving my heart empty. I needed someone. I needed a friend. That part of me was gone and all that was left was a hole. \\n\\nI continue to struggle, not knowing what to do. I started trying more.

I clicked with a few of the new people and now find myself in a great friend group.\\n\\nThe lesson here is to trust life and trust the fact that things change!!!!

Lies have finally caught up to me and the whole thing came crushing down. She gave me 2 days to move out of the house I was then living in. I was devastated, scared of what future holds and furious at myself for being so selfish, lazy and ignorant. After two days mother arrived and with tears in her eyes told me to go. I left with backpack full of clothes, phone and 5 euros. At that time I had two friends and one of them had talked his brother into letting me sleep in his garage. So there I was: lost, angry, broke. But the most prominent feeling was loneliness. No one gave a damn about where I was, how I was and will I be there in the morning. I remember that I didn't blame anyone, but I really wanted someone to talk to, someone to tell me what to do, how to get out of this mess. Eventually I found a job, a place to live, made peace with my mother, made some friends and met a brilliant girl. Last night I dreamed of this and it hit me hard. I woke up and it got me thinking: how many guys out there are suffering the same way I did? I believe that it is my obligation to share what I've learned in order to help at least one person.

The sharp stabs you get when you see friends or just people, talking and laughing without a care in the world. It hurts, and global events are forcing us to purposefully isolate ourselves. We are now more lonely than ever, social creatures deprived of contact and structure. For those who felt completely alone, you may shrug off this feeling. After all, nothing is different now.

Just dm me. I'll try to respond and set up a discord or Instagram etc.. chat.

No female friends at all. After, one used me for something she ghosted and the other ghosted when she got boyfriend . I haven’t had true friend since maybe since  high school? More I think about they weren’t true friends either. \\nAs 26 year old woman , i feel I’m at rock bottom. Last night , I cried for hours staring at the wall. I feel nobody cares about me or loves me in this world . I lost my job..I’m unemployed and broke. I don’t know how I will survive . I’m stuck in hopelessness and the loneliness makes it worse! I tried making friends online. I can’t find any female friends. It seems like women don’t want to be friends with other women. Well the men they have no interest in me besides s e x u a l  or listening to their problems. But when I need to talk they are never around.

I have entertained some of it just to have someone talk to.  I get tired of opening up app and only getting pics of a man’s private parts . But they always end up using me. It makes me feel absolutely worthless. That my value is only how I look. Sometimes I find out these men have wives or girlfriends and lie about their entire life . I know majority just want to prey on me and use me for their own selfish reasons. I completely regret ever talking to them.  I regret sending n u d e photos of myself just to have someone to talk to and to not feel lonely . Who knows what they do with pics and videos of me . I feel I can’t trust people . They disappear anyway. I feel abandoned by everyone in my life . My family , parents, and people I thought cared about me . I feel abandoned from relationships with men I was in. Part of it is my fault because I’m too nice and trust easily. When the truth is there are some people in this world with no conscience or simply evil. I feel so much regret for trusting people and opening up to be let down over and over again . The human in me gets attached to people that never cared about me in the first place. I’m writing this just as rant because I’m struggling . I missed my appointment with my therapist today on the phone because I was too depressed to get out of bed. I just need to let this out because I can’t take the heaviness of this. \\nThe feeling of loneliness sucks .

I\\'m surprised I didn\\'t die of shock.\\n\\nThere was one puzzle we did that required us to hold hands. And I just... I felt my lifelong depression disappear for that moment.

No one else has posted anything similar as far as I know so I may actually be truly alone in this.\\n\\nI've had friends before with all genders. Most of those friendships were online but some were not. Most of my friends were men. My longest friendships were with men and all the friendships I had with ladies didn't last long for reasons I'll mention later. I feel it's easier for me to have more things in common and connect more with men than women.\\n\\nI'm straight and I'm not after a relationship with anyone and that has caused problems when it comes to the friend search. When I say I'm looking for a friend I'm looking for only that, not low key looking for a relationship or friends with benefits. When I claim anywhere online I'm looking for friends I mainly get responses from men which isn't the issue. The problem is once you make it clear that you're only after friends and the chance of anything more or sexual isn't going to happen they're just gone. I understand that the desire for romance and sex is common and normal but it feels very isolating when you only want a friend. I just want someone that genuinely likes me and enjoys my company and would be fine if our relationship progresses or stays the same. Usually if I have any friends it's just one and I don't feel comfortable dating my only friend. It's seems extremely risky and irrational to risk the only friendship you have hoping the same compatibilities you have as friends will transfer into a relationship and remain stable. Like what if you break up? Who are you going to turn to if you have nobody else? Things usually aren't the same when you break up with someone and even if you remain in contact with the person  things may not even go back to being to same as when you were just friends. Being friends with guys already in a relationship is unnerving to me. I had friends get married and I never hear from them again after that and I had friends drop me because they had a partner that didn't want them to have female friends because they see them as a threat. I know that shouldn't bother me but I had a lot of friendships end after they enter a relationship even when no one expressed the slightest romantic interest in the other.\\n\\nWhen I try befriending ladies they often don't really seem interested in talking. I've had 3 friendships with ladies and unfortunately our relationship either devolved into them only coming to me for advice about their problems, not taking the advice given and returning for more advice that won't be taken or suddenly disappearing for a while only to return with no explanation and the friendship reverts to just small talk and dies.\\n\\nIt feels so isolating to be on subreddits for lonely or forever alone people when you're not after sex or low key a romantic relationship. I'm a virgin and frankly I can do with or without sex. I know not wanting sex before marriage is underrated and will most likely keep me single for a long time or forever and I accept that. I don't do one night stands or into being required to have sex with someone just because I'm dating them. I see a bit more value in waiting until marriage to have sex but I know a lot of people look down on that or don't hold that sentiment. Guys say women will always be in demand and that's true but they aren't in demand just for platonic reasons only.\\n\\nI am no longer looking for friends online and I'm tired of living in a metropolitan area. I want to move somewhere rural or suburban to hopefully be around more seemingly friendly people when I can afford to but after that I don't know what to do.

Basically, I have enjoyed following your posts over several months but I find it so sad when I see so many young people in your twenties and thirties who have only recently reached adulthood, yet you sound like you have already given up on life. I don’t have any magic formula for you , trust me if I did I would be using it myself, but you don’t need one because you all have so much going for you. You have time to look at yourselves, identify what is making you unhappy and make a plan to fix it. You have decades ahead of you to meet and fall in love with the person of your dreams don’t waste it lamenting what you don’t have. I recently finished an eighteen year relationship, and, trust me, if you think that’s hard in your twenties and thirties, try being my age. The thing is, there is always hope. I have hope that I will finally find love, but if I don’t , I’ll certainly try to have fun looking for it.\\n\\nI really enjoyed talking to all the young people the other week when I posted this. I hope everyone is doing ok and continuing to ‘hang in there’.',\n",

I\\'m not envy, I just get sad because some people are able to afford multiple vacations aboard and here I am in my home just going to the beach. It makes me compare myself, makes me feel like a loser. Like I\\'m losing out on something. Also, people on Instagram are so toxic. I caught some of my \"friends\" printing my conversations with them and sending it to someone else, and also printing their conversations with someone else and send it to me. Like what the hell is wrong with you? Respect someone\\'s privacy, something that seems impossible to achieve if you\\'re not careful in social media. Even with people you think you can trust. \\n\\nBut then I realized that these people only post pictures and stories about good moments only. Where are the posts regarding how you\\'ve failed in school last year? And let\\'s not talk about those people who post \"Pray for Amazonia\" posts and then their next story is eating a Big Mac at McDonald\\'s.\\n\\nSo yeah, now I\\'m feeling a lot better.

Then, in the evening, I received a message from my friend saying \"Happy birthday, when are we going to celebrate?\" I was so excited, that someone besides my parents and brother remembered what day it was. I replied, that I\\'m not going to throw huge party, but I would be honored, if he and his wife came to my place for a drink. Obviously they accepted.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSoon after they arrived.

I took few days off and he had work at 12, so we decided to stay at me and keep drinking.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt some point, he mentioned situation from a while ago, when he and our other friends decided to visit me and I turned them down and ordered to get the fuck out of here. Then I broke.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI told him how lonely I feel. How painful it is. How keep going became so difficult for me. I told him about moments, when I was with him or with our friends, which strengthen my loneliness and pushed me further from them. He let me speak out my mind, first time in years apparently. After I stopped speaking, he suggested me a therapy and that he could pay for it (he is quite wealthy). I told him the truth. I am in no need of a therapy. I need basic human interactions. Messaging one another, going to parties, watching movies together etc. He replied, that he will help me with that. I was so happy back then and couldn\\'t wait to end my loneliness.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDo you want to know what happened next?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAbsolutely fucking nothing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s been weeks.

What is more, I\\'ve seen a facebook\\'s post of him, his wife and our common friends attending a party, without me of course.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDid I broke? Was my heart disintegrated and my soul crushed? No.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt made me stronger. It made me stronger, because it proved that I was right from the very beginning. They are one of reasons behind my loneliness. They never wanted to hear me out, they never caring for my feelings and my whereabouts. They treated me like a background character and reached me out only when it suited them. That one time when I told them to get the fuck out here, they came drunk to my place in the middle of night at my working Wednesday in a need of finding next drinking spot. Truth is, they are egoistic, narcissistic, shallow bastards with that one guy in particular.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHe was ready to give me money, while he couldn\\'t text me \"what\\'s up\". He and this entire world is a fucking joke. If you are lonely, people wants you to go away. They are even ready to pay you for that. You can\\'t be lonely. You have to be happy. You have to socialize in a way they tell you. You have to post as much as possible on social media. YOU CAN NOT BE DIFERENT.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHear me out my dear lonely souls. You are the only one, who can make you happy. Don\\'t avoid loneliness, avoid people who makes you feel lonely. Don\\'t let them tell what to do. Find your own way. Loneliness is a high price you pay every day for being yourself.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am so done with my so called friends. I shall keep looking for that one soul I could spend rest of my life with.

I did nothing but spend the last few months of 2019 grieving over my past relationship that I have had for three years, and crying on a daily basis thinking about everything wrong that got me to where I was. I felt misunderstood and alone, and I was not content with my own company. Being alone to me was a punishment, because of the fact that I overthink or I end up crying whenever I was alone.\\n\\nTruth of the matter is, when you find happiness within yourself others can find happiness within you. I have been reflecting, and I have also learn to do things alone such as going to the gym or making my own art again.  People can only help you through the journey, but they will not go for you. It may be a lonely journey to do things for yourself and discover things, but it’s perfectly normal and fulfilling at the same time to do things independently. I no longer hate being within my own company, and instead enjoy being able to build myself up to be better than the past. I can now say I worked up to where I am now, and I am currently getting certified to facilitate family groups + doing what I love.\\n\\nOf course I have had help, but in the end I made the decision to be okay with doing things on my own. Being single and only keeping those I trust close allowed me to explore who I am and make my own future for myself.  Life goes on and everyone is living their own lives, and what they do doesn’t matter as long as YOU are happy. To everyone out there that can benefit from what I am saying, I hope all of you in this subreddit (and outside of it) find your happiness whether it is within yourself or a future significant other (both hopefully).

I have basically zero social life, and my only interactions with other humans is at work (and I'm a short-haul overnight truck driver, so not much there), the occasional Meetup, and when I go out for takeout or coffee or groceries.\\n\\nI get to watch the lives of my younger siblings, cousins, former classmates progress from the sideline of social media, posting pics of their happy memories and their families while I sit alone in my apartment drinking myself into a dull haze on my nights off to try to ignore the stagnation of my life. I see how happy and thrilled my mom is with the grandkids and beautiful daughter-in-law my younger (half) brother gave her, I see my dad comment on the engagement announcement of my other younger brother how hopeful he is for grandkids and that he's their best hope right now. I am lonely, so fucking lonely it hurts. Some nights I collapse and cry until I can't anymore, some nights I feel so close to just seriously considering ending it all because it's all so fucking pointless. This isn't how I hoped my life would turn out. My much younger self would probably cry if I could step through time and tell him where he'd be when he is facing middle age. I feel like a hollow shell of a person, just existing in a parallel world and going through the motions to sustain and distract myself.\",\n",

              "  'so i (18M) think i like being sad or maybe im just longing for emotions based off of human interaction. ive been struggling with depression and apathy for a while now and its like an endless cycle in my head. i get depressed all the time because im so behind in class assignments. im so bad at focusing on my work and most of the time my mind goes blank. i just can\\'t think. because of this and living with family, i supress these feelings and the obvious give aways like facial expressions. im finished with high school, but throughout my time there i always kept a blank face and i wasn\\'t really fond of the other kids so i only have a few \"friends\" (more like aquaintances).\\n\\n growing up it was fairly easy to make friends but once high school started, i became a totally different person. i guess that\\'s just puberty idk. i have really bad social anxiety now and its hard to have normal conversations with people outside of those i live with.  my body gets really tense and i fidget sometimes when taking to people. and because im like this, ive developed this unintentional habit of just tuning out the people around me. im terrible with small talk so i usually don\\'t have anything to say and sometimes i literally don\\'t hear what people have said to me mid convo. \\n\\nsometimes i try to think back to why im like this and i can\\'t figure out why. i just don\\'t remember the details.  my parents aren\\'t great so growing up wasnt amazing and i definitely wouldn\\'t do it again lol. i guess i subconciously processed all of my experiences and i finally understood how shitty things are around me. and that made me shitty. \\n\\nmoving on, because i constantly supress feelings and memories i struggle with apathy and its like a loop along with depression. they\\'re basically feeding off each other. i don\\'t care about things happening around me and i get depressed because i can\\'t feel anything.  but for some reason, i enjoy the sinking feeling of being sad. i honestly wish i could go to bed one night and just cry. but i can\\'t. i know that its something i shouldn\\'t be \"enjoying\" but i can\\'t help it. even while typing this, i feel worse but im ok with it. being around my family makes it worse and i can\\'t fucking wait to move out. im not really sucidal but i wish it would all just end. feeling emotionally helpless and frustrated.\\n\\n there was some thing else i wanted to write after that sentence and now i don\\'t remember. my mind just went blank. its like a camera flash feeling and i don\\'t remember what i wanted to say. i know this post is pretty long but its honestly taking so much effort just to write all this. im struggling to put my thoughts together in a way that\\'s legible and its so fucking hard. \\n\\ni feel like i want things to get worse in order it to get better.\\n\\nedit: ive sort of developed a porn addiction over the years because it\\'s the only thing that takes my mind off things and chemically makes me feel good for a brief moment. i do drink occasionally as well but ive never really been drunk. also im uh struggling with my sexuality and i think im bi but i haven\\'t really figured it out yet. so please don\\'t scroll through my profile LOL. this is an alt account.\\n\\nedit 2: holy shit i didnt realize so many people feel this way',\n",

              "  'It’s true. When you never experience warmth, affection, romance, love, you’re more than likely going to be aching for it. Unfortunately, this desperate need for those things will often lead to behaviors that turn people off from giving them to you.\\n\\nSome people use words like ‘clingy,’ ‘needy,’ ‘desperate,’ ‘pathetic,’ to describe people who feel this way. People who text/call more than most, who want to be around someone more often, who seem ‘too’ friendly, who ‘throw off the wrong signals’. And in turn, they get pushed away or ignored, when all they wanted was to be accepted, or loved.\\n\\nIt’s tough to break these patterns of behavior when you never learn the ‘right way’ to attract people, or to at least maintain adequate contact/kinship with people. On the other hand, the people who push these ‘clingers’ away seem to not want to understand them or help them understand why their behavior is repelling them from others. \\n\\nI get it, people have their own shit to deal with, and a lot of the time they don’t have the time to help someone else with their social failings or give them a chance to be connected with them so they can see the value of them as a friend or romantic partner. Hell, I’M guilty of this. I’ve pushed a girl away from me when they seemed paranoid. My rationale was always, “They’ll find someone else.” And now here I am, thinking I had finally found someone who I could relate to and who could understand me.

I\\'m a kind, cool, considerate, intelligent, charming, witty guy with a great sense of humor. Blah blah blah...\"--without sounding like a complete chump. It just feels so fake to me. I can\\'t stand it.\\nBut how else am I supposed to meet someone online?\\n\\nOf course, I could reply to posts that other people have made, but, honestly, at best half of those will end up replying to me (based on past expeirence) and I have a personal issue with being ignored even when I\\'m not feeling extremely isolated and depressed from spending months alone at home.\\nAnd before you offer me a recommendation for your favorite dating website: thank you, but no thank you. I\\'m done with dating websites. I\\'ve tried a few of them, hated them all, and refuse to go back.\\n\\nI just don\\'t know what to do.\\nThe best chance I have at meeting someone and finding a connection is by doing something that I suck at and hate doing.',\n",

              "  'selftext': 'After losing weight and regaining confidence, I (40M) decided to contact an old crush (33F) and suggested we meet for a coffee. She replied \"we can try and organise a coffee ;-)\" and we set a date &amp; time to meet in a park.\\n\\n*My crush is a work colleague who I met circa 5 years ago.* *She had a boyfriend when I first met her, whom she split with 2-3 years later.* *For the last 2.5 years she has been working in a different department and I no longer saw her daily.* *We bumped into each other from time to time and always spoke when we did.* *Despite not having asked her on a date I think she may have known that I was attracted to her as I’ve previously: offered to help her move flat; invited her hiking with friends; and invited her to social events.* *I believe that she’s shown signs of liking me as possibly more than a friend (albeit several years ago): I’ve caught her staring at me on numerous occasions; she once let me know which evenings she was free for after work socials; she laughs at all my jokes; she’s invited me to drinks with her friends and she said she’d like to sit next to me at a works meal.* *Foolishly I didn’t proactively contact her over the last 2.5 years (until now) due to being embarrassed about having put weight on, becoming scruffy in appearance and not being comfortable with myself.*\\n\\nWhen I arrived in the park to meet her, a man was sat with her (unexpectedly as she hadn’t mentioned anyone joining us). As I approached she was sat facing me on the right hand side of a picnic blanket. The man sat facing me on grass to the left hand side of the blanket. After elbow bumping her and the guy I sat on the blanket and she said to me “it’s been a long time Dave”. She then sat up straight and said “how are you” in a heightened tone. We spent the next 2.5 hours talking as if time hadn’t passed since we last met, about old times, and laughing. I brought the guy into the conversation so as not to be rude. At the end of the 2.5 hours she suggested that we go to a coffee hut where the conversation continued in the same fashion for a further hour. At the end of the hour she said that if she was arranging any future get-togethers with her friends, she’d invite me. I left the park pleased to have seen her but feeling sad that the guy was probably her boyfriend and thinking I had missed my chance. However, due to her not having mentioned to me that she had a boyfriend (during arranging to meet), or that the guy with her was her boyfriend and them not sitting close to each other, the optimist in me thought they may just be good friends. 10 days passed and the question ‘is he her boyfriend’ played on my mind? I phoned her and told her “I’d like to ask you out for dinner but don’t know if you are in a relationship and don’t want to cause any friction:\\n\\nShe replied:…“You met him”…”Charlie is my boyfriend”.\\n\\nI replied: “Yeah I did meet him, but it wasn’t clear to me”.\\n\\nShe replied:…“I introduced you”…”We got a place together before lockdown”.\\n\\nI replied: “It wasn’t clear to me, perhaps confusion on my part”.\\n\\nShe replied: “It’s okay, forget it…Okay this is what to do, invite me to social events and Charlie and I will come. If Charlie can’t be bothered, then I’ll just come (nervous laugh by her)”.\\n\\nI replied: “Okay. I’m glad you’re happy and I hope you continue to be happy. Speak soon” \\\\[I then ended the call\\\\].\\n\\nI am now left with regret due to not making my intent or feelings clear several years ago.',\n",

I've recently been thinking about how everything I do, everyone I befriend, is all because of an intense need for someone to care about me. I had this friend when I was very young and he and I used to play these kinda... roleplay games. He'd always be my older brother and he'd always be really caring and... protect me I guess. I'm in junior high now and I see him all the time and I desperately want that relationship back. All the TV shows and movies I watch have someone with that relationship, that someone cares very strongly about another person. The caring person (followed by the one being cared for) always ends up being my favorite character. Take the TV show House for example (If you know it). Wilson is my favorite character, followed by House. I just wanted to say this to someone. Maybe one of you will actually read it. I don't know what to do anymore honestly. Is there something wrong with me?\",\n",

They shared the same social anxiety, mental health problems and we seemed to connect so well... they kept saying they’d do anything to help me. The person wanted to keep chatting even more, we really hit it up.\\n\\nTo my surprise they confessed their feelings to me, but they misunderstood my response. I heard from them less and less, yet I tried my hardest to be supportive for them… putting aside my health and freaking out so much over my mistake. I could tell they were getting suicidal, but I felt helpless. I never expected perfection of them… but I feared they’d lose interest in me if I was anything less\\n\\nIt hurt to find out that multiple nights of endless pain and suicidal feelings, the whole time they were there… just avoiding me… I never expected perfection of them, I'll clarify that what upset me was that it felt like I couldn't make the same errors... \\n\\nThe point of this message isn't to give blame or call myself the victim, my guilt and anxiety wear at me after I convinced myself to unfriend. It keeps haunting me... what if they don't hate me, what if they actually would listen to me once they calmed down? I just don't know if my own mental stability can handle this... please I really don't know what to do but I can't make this message any longer\",\n",

              "  'selftext': 'I never imagined being a victim of abuse would make one feel isolated from the world. For it to feel like no one understands, and you’re in this completely alone. People don’t want to talk about it, they get awkward and uncomfortable when you talk about what you’re going through. So they change the subject so they won’t feel uncomfortable anymore, not knowing how crushing it feels to have ones issues shooed off. You try and seek help and even those who are abuse survivors can’t lend you advice. That’s how deep in shit I’m in. That even those you’d think would be supportive and encouraging won’t say a word. \\n\\nAll I want is for someone to listen. All I want is someone to be by my side and be there for me. I’m not asking for them to get me out, or save me. All I’m asking is for someone to be there. Someone to listen. Someone to gather up enough sympathy to say “hey. I’m here.” I don’t understand.. ever since the abuse came back I realized how isolated this is. How I’m on the other side of the wall, and everyone else are on the opposite side. Even when I wave and call for company, they look, and keep walking. It makes me doubt anyone really cares. But I won’t fall into that deep hole of being cynical. I know people care.. they have to. They just don’t know what to do or say.. so they’d rather keep walking.',\n",

Right at the top:\\n\\n\"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" she said. \"The attachment I have towards you is unhealthy and it is drowning me\".\\n\\nThis was actually happening, my heart sank as I sat at the edge of the sofa muting the television to better focus on the text. I opened it. It was Eva. The most beautiful girl I had ever met; she was out of my league and had black curly hair, she always threatened me she would cut and beautiful skin that glowed when it was hit by the sun, and the most gorgeous smile that made winter feel like summer. Her signature fragrance suddenly filled the room, Dior J\\'adore with a hint of roses or perhaps I only imagined it.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" I responded\\n\\n\"I can\\'t focus with you around. You make me...wonder, I am suddenly unable to think, unable to cope\".\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t that mean you love me\" I said foolishly\\n\\n\"I neglect myself, you suffocate me\" she responded.\\n\\n\\nI quickly realized she wasn\\'t looking for a reason to fight anymore. A reason to stay, a reason to hold on to what we had like she always did. She had changed. She had become cold...distant. She wanted a way out.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want to talk about this when you get back from New York?\"\\n\\n...\\n\\n\"What is there to talk about?\" Eva asked\\n\\n~We should talk about us and what we have. We still have a lot to talk about, plus I have changed for you. For us.~\\n\\n\"Us\" \\n\\n\"Us? I can no longer handle your outbursts, accusations, self-destructive behavior and disrespect to me as a person\".\\n\\n~It\\'s over. She doesn\\'t want to have to deal with this anymore. She doesn\\'t want me to fight. She wants me to let her go.~\\n\\nI had dug my own grave, she warned me she would get tired of me. I only prolonged the inevitable. She needed time away from me, thats why she left to convince herself she didn\\'t need me, she didn\\'t want me, she didn\\'t love me.\\n\\n\"I still love you, it burns\" her text popped\\n\\n~3 more weeks before I could see her, maybe I could still convince her, help her understand I am the one for her~\\n\\n\"Could we work on it together when you get back? Whatever the problem is?\"\\n\\nA drop of tear hit the screen of my phone. I quickly smeared it off.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s fight for what we have left, we can still do this\".\\n\\n\"You can, I can\\'t. Goodbye Charles\".\\n\\nShe was gone.',\n",

Even if I care about them as much as I can it’s still not enough to make up for my mishaps and lack of being able to read the room. I think a lot about how to be the best person I can be, but I have trouble being a cool and relatable friend after awhile. I really wish it wasn’t this way. I love the friends I do have and when I notice the loss of interest or we don’t talk nearly as much anymore it stings my heart. I just want someone to call and have fun with and talk about anything. Instead it’s fun for a few weeks or more if I’m lucky then it crashes into disappointment and I end up feeling guilty for not being more interesting or getting to comfortable.

Because of the crazy situation of abuse (emotional, physical) and abandonment I was asked to testify after my brother, sister &amp; i spoke with the judge in his privet chambers. He Hurd the stories.\\n    My dad innocent of hurting us didn\\'t have a chance of getting custody in the 70s. He was working as a merchant marine and not in the state 6 months of if the year. On top of that mostly mothers got custody back then. Sidenote it was a landmark ruling and in law books.\\n    I was terrified to testify but I knew I had too, my brother &amp; sisters wellness depended on it. In court I was asked questions that still echo in my head. Then I answered a question that to this day tares my sole. Why do you belive custody be granted to your biological father? I spoke without a filter from the heart not knowing the weight my words would carry.  \"Mom has too many boyfriends i don\\'t like \" . The words still scath me. \\n   So for so many years I waited for my mom to pick me up on my birthday in April.  She always came in February for my younger sister then March for my brother. I was next and she knew where we lived.   She never came.  Not once for me although year after year I still sat and waited. I don\\'t know how old I was when I stopped waiting or stopped crying over it. Truth be told I still get emotional about it. My mom never came for me. \\n   No special birthday,  no cards Christmas or otherwise,  no phone calls,  no gifts,  letters or words. Maybe now I have incite along with guilt. That only age can bring. \\n    After I answered that dreaded question. Mom responded to it. I suppose  sealing the judge\\'s decision. To me at 8 the gravity of her words meant little. Even when the judge demanded order banging his hammer. She was my mom so how could what she said be true \"your not my son\" .',\n",

Even though I spent a surprising amount with people today, from visiting family to seeing a movie with friends, I still felt sad. The one who is close to my heart is now many, many miles away. She is due to return in a month, but I’m not going to talk to her or see her or text her until then. Everything reminds me of her. My sister asked how she was doing. WW84 was lame, but it still reminded me of her. \\n\\nI’m ok right now? But in the mornings, I just don’t want to do anything. She won’t be around that day, so I can hardly get motivated to start the day. My favorite Christmas gifts were from her. When I see them, wear them, eat them (all different gifts, mind you), of course, I think of her. \\n\\nAs I sit in my quiet house, I just feel like I’m waiting.',\n",

              "  'selftext': \" 19F\\n\\n**TL;DR  Not sure if I have some kind of underlying mental issue that’s causing  me all of these problems in my life or if I truly am just lazy,  overdramatic, cynical and not working hard enough.**\\n\\nNot  posting this for sympathy points, I know that my actions and problems  are down to me and I am actively working to solve them and have been  trying to for years. Just want to vent or perhaps get some insight. I'm  currently working with a PWP on social anxiety and it’s very slow  because of the huge gaps between appointments, but I do feel as if my  issues go beyond social anxiety.\\n\\nI  struggle to speak about my issues during appointments because I feel as  if I’m going to cry very often, which annoyingly interferes with your  ability to speak, and also because of my extreme sensitivity to  rejection. In the moment, I suddenly think my problems are very stupid  and I’m just wasting her time like I did with my school councillor.  Therefore, I’m considering emailing her with a big long list of my  issues because, knowing myself, if she never directly asks me then it  will never get brought up.\\n\\n**MY PROBLEMS:**\\n\\n* I’ve  always been shit with eye contact. It feels too intense and like it  burns and I constantly have to remind myself that I should be doing it.  Sometimes I’m not too bad looking in someone’s eyes when they’re talking  but I’m never good at doing it while I’m talking.\\n* I  spend time every day thinking about how I hate the way that I look. I’m  always analyzing the faces of everyone I see and comparing myself  against them. I’m always looking in the mirror, and whenever I go out  I’m always checking myself in every car and shop window and browsing for  new outfits as if I think that getting the perfect clothing style will  fill the hole.\\n* I’m  convinced everyone hates me. If they do seem to like me, it’s only  because they don’t know me very well yet and haven’t seen through the  fake personality I crafted for them, or it’s because they pretend to  like me because they literally don’t have any other options for friends  or would feel rude ditching me. If they don’t hate me yet, they will,  and every opportunity speaking to them is an opportunity to mess things  up because they’ll find out I’m a fraud.\\n* I  can make new friends with strangers relatively easily because I just  make the conversation all about them, meaning conversations mostly end  up feeling like an interview where I’m asking someone questions and  listening and responding to what they have to say, but don’t offer much  myself due to an intense fear of rejection.\\n* I  struggle with maintaining friendships because nobody knows me because I  don’t talk about myself. I don’t talk about myself because I think I’m  boring and have nothing to talk about. I have nothing to talk about  because I have no hobbies. I have no hobbies because I waste every day  of my life scrolling through social media which makes me feel very  ashamed.\\n* I  struggle to finish anything that doesn’t have a deadline. This means I  rarely do anything fun because I think I’ll ‘get them done after I do my  work’. But I never start my work or only start it at 2am so I never get  a chance to do those things. My friends always talk about all these  shows they’ve watched or all these games they’ve played but I never seem  to have enough hours in a day. It really distresses me because I feel  like I’m watching my life drain away and I’ll never accomplish anything  that I’m desperate to. I’m miserable because I rarely do the things I  find enjoyable and the pandemic has made me painfully aware that the  reason I wasn’t accomplishing these things wasn’t actually because I  ‘didn’t have enough time due to school’.\\n* I  suck in most group conversations so I mostly prefer one-on-one  conversations but I also dread them because I feel an overwhelming  responsibility to entertain the other person the whole time.\\n* “I  feel like I’m working four times as hard as everyone else and getting  half the results.” I’m always frustrated by how naturally others seem to  just ‘get’ the social world and how they so rarely seem to have really  bad days. I’m never sure if I’m actually different to everyone because  I’m always told it’s just in my head, so my biggest fear is that there’s  actually nothing holding me back and I really am just not working hard  enough.\\n* Sometimes  I have these weird emotional ‘blow-ups’ that I really can’t explain  because I don’t even know what I’m feeling during those times where I  vent or go mute. I’m self-conscious that this often looks like  attention-seeking. They’re not, I don’t really know what they are.\\n* I’m jealous of anyone else’s success because I feel like I have nothing going for me. This makes me feel like an arsehole.\\n* Many  times I’ve been called weird and it always majorly hurt my feelings  because I’m really not sure what it is I’m doing wrong. I’m always  worried I give off a weird ‘vibe’ or something without realizing,  especially when people I’ve been making an effort to befriend for ages  and I think it’s going well with, suddenly start talking to a new person  and immediately have so much more chemistry and fluidity of  conversation than I’ve ever had with them. It’s probably because  everyone else always loves to talk about themselves but I struggle with  that or overdo it.\\n* I feel incompetent compared to everyone else.\\n* I have my own marvel cinematic universe in my head that I spend a lot of time distracting myself with each day.\\n* Everything  gets so much worse when I’m on my period/around the time of my period.  It took me ages to realize that my biggest mood dips occur during this  time. I spend many days of my period feeling tearful or crying, if one  tiny thing going wrong it ruins my whole day.\\n\\nSometimes  I feel like my problems aren’t that severe and I’m just behind but I’ll  catch up, or I’m not pushing myself hard enough. Then I have to remind  myself that my mental health hasn’t been good since year 7 when I  suddenly realized I had no clue how to interact with people, and while I  have slowly improved in confidence over the years I frequently lapse  back into a bit of a ‘meltdown’ after the novelty of going into a new  school year and thinking “this one will be different because I’ll  achieve the things I want to and make close friends” has worn off.\\n\\n**I relate a lot to the struggles of people with**  BPD, but I’ve never self-harmed and I don’t have some whacky, abusive  childhood. I relate a lot to girls with Aspergers and listen to videos  on Youtube of them putting into words so many things I’ve struggled  with, but I don’t think I have a special interest and I don’t think I’ve  ever struggled with looking at a facial expression and knowing how  someone is feeling or being super irritated by a fabric. I relate to  female inattentive ADHD struggles but I passed every GCSE and A level  with A\\\\* bar 2 (without much revision, mind you) and I was never a  difficult kid. I let my workspace get messy but I always inevitably  clean it because I can’t stand the clutter. But I don’t feel normal  either?\",\n",

              "  'selftext': \"I always get extra lonely around this time of the year. I'm 26 years old and I currently spend my time playing a single game, i wish i would get a 40 hour job but currently only 2 days a week and i'm trying to learn webdev.   \\n\\n\\nAround this time of every year I always get sad because i'm alone. Usually I can keep my emotions to myself but the added stress of not being able to pay rent/corona just taking a toll on me. I'm internally conflicted about why i'm alone and at a bad place in life. I keep going back and forth that it's my fault and at the same time that it isn't my fault. I don't have contact with my family, don't have any friends to talk to, havn't had a girlfriend for 10+ years.   \\n\\n\\nI could go indepth about how this all ended up like this but i will spare you the details, if anyone reads this. Basicly if i could change things in my past, i would change many things.  \\n\\n\\nI sometimes wish i could drink alcohol or smoke weed to relieve me of some of my emotions. But I just can't drink alcohol anymore, i don't know, after a few sips I just don't want anything anymore. And weed.. well let's just say I get stuck in my own head and start overthinking many things..\\n\\nI honestly don't know where i'm going with this, my heart feels heavy and i just want to cry. Am i depressed? Am i overreacting?\",\n",

I am just getting a bit tired of being so touch starved, I am about to 26 soon and I would probably never be open to people about how socially useless I am. I am not sure people can tell I have never really had much of a social life, I grew up with an eating disorder, bad stress, fatigue, and was always terrible with alcohol so I could never just have a good time, I was always stressed out about the place I was in.\\n\\n\\nI just would like to find someone to be romantic with, i've missed out on a lot and I am tired. It sucks feeling really unattractive, partially when girls have been interested in me in my life my confidence was always like they don't want to be near me and stupid nonsense like that. Hopefully this year has changed it and I can be open about my feelings with someone.\\n\\njust want to date, you lot probably know the feeling. Would like someone to hold, share myself around, care deeply about what they are about and just be happy for a bit. but no\\n\\nJust a sad post about lack of romance I guess, if anyone shares similar thoughts I am here to chat.\\n\\nthanks for finishing reading my vent post, have a cookie and leave a comment in the comment section on your way out.\",\n",

So basically today I realized I’ve never been actually happy in years and my mom and I kept clashing together argument after argument. \\n\\nBasically we are gonna sell my car because it I go 100 mile round trips in two days every week to go to my dads and it’s just wearing the car down. Today we went to the dealership and she was talking to guy and was like that’s a tree huger guy and me and my sister were laughing of embarrassment. \\n\\n\\nShe went off on me when we left saying I don’t need to listen to my kid try to tune me up for my first amendment ect ect. We kept colliding and when we got home I was all curled up in bed on my phone just hanging out. And she said oh your gonna really pout ect and I said I’m not pouting I’m just trying to not deal with what happened and de escalate tensions. And she said I’m trying to buy you these things you want to make you happy and I said just stop trying I’ve never been happy and don’t like to talk about it. \\n\\nThe only time I was actually happy was when I was with my ex before she falsely accused me of assault. Other then that I’ve never been really happy and I only smile when I’m driving fast because it’s basically my therapy and keeps my mind off of things. (Speed therapy)\\n\\nAnd when I drive I just wonder to myself imagine if I crashed and just got it over with. What would people think? What would it be like? Ect ect \\n\\nI’m sorry I just wanted to rant',\n",

              "  'selftext': \"Now, this is my philosophy. I've felt that we associate being lonely with miserable, not good enough or worthless because we are conditioned to feel that having friends, people to discuss things with is a very good thing. Advertisements, social media everything forces on socialising.\\nNow, humans are inherently social creatures and we should socialise but it's not the end of the world if we don't..\\nMost of the people are anyways self absorbed and think about themselves. And it's not a bad thing per se but I feel that people who feel lonely do so because they have higher expectations from others. More often than not, they'll put them in the situation and think, I wouldn't have done this if I was them and then we start to feel bad that maybe it's something with us that they do this to us.\\nMy approach is to think, maybe they don't see what I see. Maybe, I have not met the correct people yet and last but not the least, it's okay to not having friends and be alone. Self discovery is also a biggg thing and when you learn to be alone, you'll see it's the best thing! No drama, no nonsense, just you! \\nSelf love will develop but it's gotta be you only.\\nAnd for the expectations, always keep them from yourself.\",\n",

All my life I had friends to hang out with and have great laughs almost every single night of my life. I don’t have any of that anymore, due to me fucking up big time. It’s very much well deserved, but the transition from being a socialite to just somebody with only three friends is harrowing. I feel like a burden to them. I talk too much about random things and sometimes it feels like I’m annoying them. Everyday I imagine myself still with the rest of my friend groups, talking to them, hanging out with them. When I’m playing a game, I imagine myself in a call with them, talking about stuff until I snap out of it and I’m disappointed with myself. I want to move on and make more friends, to stop being lonely and actively change myself for the better but it’s hard too when all you can think of is your former friends. Hell, some nights I even dream about them. This night is one of those nights, but the dream was awfully too real and its just left me awake. I don’t know how others can be so lonely like this for years, for a majority of their life. But I think we’ll get through this, as long as we try and keep on pushing.',\n",

I have no luck with women in my area and not able to meet any new people due to being in a very small town away from anywhere.  \\n\\n I am short for a man and I know many women ( the ones I tried to date) have a problem with that. If you don't then that would be amazing!\\n\\nI am 30, I am usually easy-going, down to earth or I can be a little hyped, outgoing, patience, understanding, open minded.\\n\\nI do not care about race at all, I love all different people for who they are, never judge people for what they look like but only how they treat others.\\nIf you are interested or just simply wanting to talk dont hesitate to!\",\n",

I wish I wasn't so lonely, I wish I could help myself more, I want to stop disappointing people, being able to focus on something would be nice, I want to be in a relationship that lasts longer than a month, I want to be held by someone and when they tell me it will be ok I want to believe them.  People keep saying things will get better but it's been like this for a year and there has been no improvement. If anything it's gotten worse. To be honest I don't like venting like this because I know that a whole lot of people are doing a whole lot worse than me but it gets to a point where I can't hold it in anymore. I don't know why I'm doing this; it won't make me feel better or anything, I just like seeing that people care sometimes. I guess if I had to come up with one thing that I want the most, I just want to feel normal again. I want to feel how I felt before I got depression. That's probably why I want to be in a relationship. It's the closest I get to feeling like that again. Sorry this was so long, and sorry that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But if you got this far then thanks for reading at least.\",\n",

I keep pretending to myself that I'm fine but I'm not..\\nMe and my boyfriend broke up nearly a month ago and that did take a troll on me. It hurt like hell and I didn't know what to do. I promised myself to not get attached to anyone again. It's what I have been doing... But I don't know how long I can bear all this pain till I break. \\nI'm crying pretty often, not just about my breakup but about everything in my life. Everything that goes wrong. \\nI come from a family of over achievers and I feel like a loser.  \\nThanks to this pandemic, I'm away from my friends as well. I'm all alone with my thoughts and exam time gets it worse. \\nI'm a fucking chicken, I can't even take a little risk. I don't even know what happening with my life.\\nFuck my life. \\nI'm trying to get back up and dust myself ... But I'm not able to.\",\n",

He told me that deep down, he never really felt his friends were his real friends. For example, his best friend only befriended him to get help with his homework. This friend also borrowed a textbook from him in college but ghosted him and never returned the textbook. Moreover, his girlfriend only dated him because she liked the thought of going out with someone popular.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe said that deep down he was actually lonely. Some people may look like they have lots of friends and look happy together, but there may be a lot of unresolved tension between each other. Also, some people also make friends just because they fear the stigma of having no friends. That being said, you should not feel too sad seeing your schoolmates (if you are in school) or your coworkers (if you are a working adult) hanging out with their friends in public.

              "  'selftext': 'Bit of context\\nI knew 2 of these 3 best friends in high school and throughout the last 2 years, they were both in committed relationships. Every meetup with us and another group of friends always felt kinda isolating because they\\'d barely take any notice of me or anyone else.\\n\\nFast forward 2 years later, 1 of these best friends and I stopped talking because of was sick of him just leaving everyone behind for his bitch of a gf. And the other one I remained bff\\'s with and she\\'s still my best friend of all time today. But now we\\'re all relatively friends again. The 3rd best friend I met this year. And within the space of a few weeks from each other. All 3 of them started getting into relationships. It\\'s made me realise that I\\'m missing something and that I actually do want to be with someone\\n\\nUntil now I\\'ve been very back and forth with myself on relationships, sometimes I want one and other times I\\'d rather jump off a cliff. But now that the 3 closest people I know are in one.. Its making feel kinda isolated and alone.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'ve got a few mental issues. I\\'ve been through a lot in my life and it\\'s led to things like anger management issues and some bouts of depression and I don\\'t wanna potentially inflict any of my issues onto a partner.\\n\\nI try to be a good person and not let these things get me down but lately it\\'s been super hard. I like helping people and I like taking an interest in what my friends do (naturally). But lately I just wanna turn around and tell them to stfu about their relationships, Congrats, you made out with someone, I don\\'t really care.\\n\\nObviously I\\'m jealous, and I\\'m scared I\\'m just gonna end up getting left behind by them. There won\\'t be anymore bro meet ups or anything like that. It\\'ll be \"Yeah we can do that.. But my gf is coming\" or if the gf isn\\'t there they\\'ll just be texting the entire time\\n\\n(sorry I\\'m rambling)\\n\\nAnother thing that really boils my piss is that one of my best friends doesn\\'t understand what I\\'m like with girls. I\\'m not someone who will meet a girl at a bar, have a one night stand and then pretend they never existed. Relationships scare the shit out of them but I can\\'t help but want to be with someone.\\n\\nI\\'m not really the normal kind of 18 YO either. I\\'m a huge nerd who collects stuff, replicas and shit and that\\'s not exactly something girls my age find very attractive, instead they find it rather sad.\\n\\nSorry for rambling, I just really needed to get this off my chest',\n",

              "  'selftext': 'I’m 17 in my last year of school. I grew up with close friends and never struggled with loneliness until I moved. When I moved I spent a good couple of years with no friendship group. I have ‘friends’ in classes who I speak to but that’s it. I don’t go out to do things with them and I’m not in a group chat. I also had never had anyone have a crush on me or try to get with me from school. My ‘talking stages’ with people I met over that embarrassing app, yubo, always failed. \\n\\nA couple of months ago I met a guy who went to my school on Yubo. We talked and we got along. After a month we went on our first date and went on more. The fact that anyone wanted to meet me was beyond me. We had amazing dates and about a week ago he made me his girlfriend. This for me is a completely new experience that I wanted to talk about to my fellow lonely people. \\n\\nI remember acting like I had friends around him. I talked about them but kept my life private at the same time. I didn’t want him knowing in case he found it weird. I used to see him a lot around school and I was always alone which was kind of embarrassing. Sometimes I pretended like I was on the phone calling someone, asking where they were. In reality, I was calling myself and I was probably on my way to a toilet stall where I’d eat lunch. He then asked about my friends on one of our dates and asked why he always saw me alone. I then briefly explained my situation, I couldn’t lie. There would be no way I could get away with lying. He said he felt bad and if he was always free if I wanted to meet up. No one had ever been like that with me. I was quite surprised at what he said. It was so nice to know that finally someone cared.\\n\\nHe fixed my only a small part of my loneliness however. I’m extremely grateful for him but the fact is, I still have no friends. I am yet to meet his friends and I’m scared that they know my situation. We haven’t been able to meet in school because of covid and school closures so I guess we will see. There are still going to be moments where i’m lonely. When I spend my free periods or lunches when he’s not in school in the library alone or a toilet stall. \\n\\nNot only is physically being alone an issue it has also affected my mindset. I still don’t believe I’m one of his priorities or that he actually cares about me because no one has in a while. I have a lot of trust issues because I don’t think i’m worthy enough and I believe I’m unwanted and unloveable. I need constant reassurance.\\n\\nI am also afraid of the possible break up. I know that he is my only one. I have no group of friends to fall back on. If I lose him I will be back to square one, completely alone. I don’t want to rely on him too much because It’s going to make things difficult if something bad does happen. You see, when you’re lonely you treasure every inch of interest or affection someone shows you    because you are so deprived of it. If someone has a conversation with me, my day is made. I’m scared I’ll get too attached to him and my mental health will rely on him too much.\\n\\nSo that is my experience being ‘lonely’ in a relationship. I thought it would fix my issue of loneliness but it hasn’t unfortunately.',\n",
